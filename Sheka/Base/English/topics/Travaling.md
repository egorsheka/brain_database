# Traveling 
## Article 
I like to being in a traveling when you are't just a holidaymaker. Now I think I never stay in a holiday hotel with huge swimming pool and enormous verity of food, It's boring. I go for experience and want that my journey be longer and more challenging. I try to avoid tourist trap and like to go off popular tracks to discover new places.
